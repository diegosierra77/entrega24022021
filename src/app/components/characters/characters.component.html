        <p class="card-text">Around 1592 Galileo invented an apparatus that allows to detect the change of temperature through a liquid. In 1666-1667 John Locke made observations indoors at Oxford for medical purposes, and in 1714 Fahrenheit invented the modern mercury thermometer. Years later you will enter your temperature scale.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Albert Eintein</h5>
        <p class="card-text">the most famous scientist of the 20th century maintains his charisma and his legacy decades after his death. Born German, later nationalized Swiss and finally American, Albert Einstein left for posterity great theories, indelible phrases and what is surely the most popular equation in the history of science: E = mc2, the equivalence between mass and energy with speed of light squared as a multiplication factor. Much to his regret, this formula cleared the way for the atomic bomb. Einstein, a convinced pacifist, always considered that having urged President Roosevelt to finance nuclear research was one of the mistakes of his life, even knowing that it was necessary to win the race to Germany. Using physics as a starting point, his discoveries have made their mark in a wide variety of fields, and his predictions continue to be confirmed even today . The last one, gravitational waves . His status as a popular icon even led to him being offered the  presidency of Israel , an honor he emotionally declined.</p>
